# Causal Recommendation System Development

This repository contains the implementation of a causal recommendation system that leverages causal inference techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy. Designed for scalability, the system incorporates advanced machine learning models and rigorous evaluation methodologies.

---

## Description

The causal recommendation system employs causal inference principles to provide recommendations that are both effective and unbiased. By integrating state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning and causal analysis, this project aims to improve user engagement and experience in recommendation systems.

## Features
- **Causal Inference**: Utilizes causal relationships to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Suitable for large datasets and real-time applications.
- **Advanced Evaluation Metrics**: Includes A/B testing and traditional machine learning metrics.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Modular structure for easy integration and modification.
